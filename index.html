<h2>The World's Smartest Cities</h2>
<h3>Ben Abrahams <br> FIT3179 <br> Assignment 2</h3>

<h1>What Are Smart Cities?</h1>
<p>
  The different Smart Indexes for city were determined by the Leap Data team in an attempt to <br>
  quantify how efficient, modern and well run each city is. This was determined by analysing <br>
  multiple public datasets that included information about each city. The "smarter" a city is <br>
  in a specific category, means it will have a higher index in that category.
  
  
  <br> <br> <span style="color: #FF0000"> Note: </span>
  the Smart City Index is not necessarily based on the total sum of each individual index <br>
  as some indexes were deemed more import than others. What classifies as a city is based <br>
  on each government's classification. This list does not include all cities in the world <br>
  but only the top 96 Smartest Cities.


</p>

<h1>Smart Cities Around The World</h1>
  
<div id="dot_map"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">

  var spec2 = "js/dot_map.json";
  vegaEmbed('#dot_map', spec2, {"actions": false}).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>

<p id="one">As you can see from the dot map, the majority of Smart Cities are located in <br> Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.
    Europe has by far the highest density <br> of Smart Cities most likely because many of these cities are wealthy, have relatively <br> small
    populations and high education rates leading to more development and <br> modernising of their cities. <span style="color: #216bf3">Finland</span> has 9 Smart Cities
    despite having a relatively <br> small population and GDP whilst <span style="color: #FF0000">Japan</span>, only has 2 smart Cities with its enormous <br> population and GDP.
    Of course it is possible that this is due to the way a Smart City <br> is calculated/determined, however it is important to note the 
    differences between <br> countries such as Finland and Japan to see what makes a country have more or <br> less Smart Cities.</p>


<h1>Affects of Population on Smart Indexes</h1>
  
<div id="splom"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">

  var spec2 = "js/splom.json";
  vegaEmbed('#splom', spec2, {"actions": false}).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>
<p id="two">
  Shown in the scatter plot matrix, is how the Smart Indexes change with the cities population. <br> The Smart People Index,
  appears to be relatively randomly distributed, with population showing <br> no apparent effect. Smart Government, Smart Environment 
  and to some extent, Smart Economy <br> appear to <span style="color: #FF0000">decrease</span> as population increases. This is likely due to large cities
  having more government <br> officials and layers of government which makes it more difficult to effectively lead and use
  their money <br> well. Larger cities also tend to be more poluted and harder to install renewables such as wind turbines <br>
  and hydroelectric power plants as all the space is taken up by housing. 
  
  <br> <br>Smart Mobility tends to <span style="color: #0084ff">increase</span> as population increases, possibly due to more people resulting <br> in a greater need for
  effective and smart transportation services to facilitate the large number of <br> people.
  The Smart City Index appears to be uneffected by population with cities of all size <br> having an average score of 6000.

<h1>Comparing 5 Smart Cities</h1>
<div id="stacked_bar"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">

  var spec2 = "js/stacked_bar.json";
  vegaEmbed('#stacked_bar', spec2, {"actions": false}).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>

<p id="three">
  This stacked bar chart breaks down 5 cities of interest, into their scores by category. Melbourne <br> has a quite high smart living
  and is almost as big as some of the Top 10 Smartest Cities such as Montreal <br> and Singapore. Melbourne also has
  a comparatively low Smart Economy Index, which may be one of <br> the reasons why it didn't reach the Top 10.
  Singapore has the largest index out of any city in any <br> category with a <span style="color: #117de2">10,000 in Smart Living.</span>
  Montreal has the highest sum of indexes here as it is strong <br> in every single category particularly in Smart Economy.
</p>


<h1>How Does Melbourne Compare To Other Smart Cities?</h1>
  
<div id="barchart"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">

  var spec2 = "js/barchart.json";
  vegaEmbed('#barchart', spec2, {"actions": false}).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>

<p id="four">Melbourne often ranks highly on the most liveable and best cities in the world and still ranks quite highly <br>
    in the Smart Cities Index. With a Smart City Index of 6061, Melbourne is ranked 54th on this list, suggesting that <br>
    <span style="color: #117de2">Melbourne is the 54th Smartest City in the world</span>. Melbourne ranks closely with other Oceanic cities, such as <br> Auckland,
    Perth and Sydney. Melbourne is also closer to the highest listed city Montreal, than to the lowest, Shanghai.</p>
